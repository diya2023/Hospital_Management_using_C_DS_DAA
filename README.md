# Hospital_Management_using_C_DS_DAA
Updated version of Hospital_Management_System_using_C

This Hospital Management System is an upgraded version of a previously developed project. It now leverages data structures like linked lists for improved efficiency and dynamic memory allocation. This system is designed to facilitate efficient patient data management, billing, and more within a hospital or healthcare setting.

# Features

- Patient Data Management: Efficiently input, edit, and manage patient data, including personal information, medical history, and contact details.
- Billing: Generate detailed bills for patients, calculate expenses, and maintain transparent financial records.
- Data Validation: Robust input validation to ensure data integrity, including checks for valid phone numbers, landline numbers, Aadhar card numbers, and gender inputs.
- Dynamic Memory Allocation: Utilizes dynamic memory allocation for efficient storage and management of patient records using linked lists.
- User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive user interface for ease of use, reducing the learning curve for hospital staff.

# How to Use
